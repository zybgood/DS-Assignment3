// Explanation:
// - The test code creates a separate thread pool to run each test scenario concurrently.
// - "testImmediateResponseMode": Ensures all members respond without delay, testing immediate consensus.
// - "testRandomDelaysAndFailures": Simulates random delays, dropouts, and offline behavior among members.
// - "testMultipleProposersSimultaneously": Tests if multiple proposers can handle conflicts and if only one proposal succeeds.
// - Each test waits for some time to allow the election process to complete.
// - ExecutorService is used to manage threads for testing concurrency issues.

// Note: This testing harness assumes that the CouncilElection class is capable of managing its own state appropriately,
// and that its main methods (e.g., runProposer and runAcceptor) can be safely called from different threads.
// Also, the server threads (acceptors) should be already running before the test cases are executed.
